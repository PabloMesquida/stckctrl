Furthermore, the system includes robust stock control functionalities that meticulously track stock levels, considering size and color variants, and provide timely notifications for low inventory, thereby aiding in proactive replenishment strategies.

The system enables users to register sales, thereby establishing a comprehensive sales history for future analysis and generating reports to facilitate informed decision-making. Leveraging the Tailwind CSS framework, the system offers flexibility for customization and the creation of visually appealing and responsive interfaces. The user interface is meticulously optimized for mobile devices, taking into account the unique requirements and constraints of smartphones and tablets. Employing responsive design principles, the system ensures an intuitive and seamless user experience across various screen sizes.
